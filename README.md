In this notebook a Resnet model is trained on the CIFAR10 dataset. The tranining is done on cifar10 dataset with option for random labels.

The neural network model was taken from https://github.com/xternalz/WideResNet-pytorch.

The noetbook is inspired by https://github.com/pluskid/fitting-random-labels.

The notebook was developed and tested on https://colab.research.google.com/ with GPU backend.
