# FittingRandomDataToResnetCNN

This notebook replicates the results from "UNDERSTANDING DEEP LEARNING REQUIRES RETHINKING GENERALIZATION" .

In this notebook a Resnet model is trained on the CIFAR10 dataset. The tranining can be done on random labels of the dataset.

The neural network model was taken from https://github.com/xternalz/WideResNet-pytorch.

All the noetbook was inspired by https://github.com/pluskid/fitting-random-labels.

The notebook was developed and tested on https://colab.research.google.com/ with GPU backend.
